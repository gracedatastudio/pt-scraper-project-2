DGe; Yes, 010193-019 is in the Amazon required list

@Ana Pastor, what is the status of RFC-210116, the redesign of the movable stop? 
APas: A first review was done and waiting for the changes to be implemented. I think it can be ready this Q2 as well.

PvdP: When it?s ready for release we can inform Dennis to start making a copy of it and removing the fixed colours. I suggest that we don?t release the latest revision of the movable stop but remove it, the new movable stop which Dennis will create will be the one we need to add in the PDB.",Yes,-,.M # Accessories,Yes,Captured in ticket ITTISLIBS-3845,TSG,Yes,Yes,C01,026205-053,SLD01090056,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,In Progress,,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
